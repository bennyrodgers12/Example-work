# Example-work

Soap bubble measurement: Determine the thickness of a soap bubble by its interferring reflected light using an iPhone image. This was a project for an undergraduate optics course.

IR_Final_works: My first C++ script in Arduino, to control an LCD scoreboard using an infrared remote. 

ParseStandbyCSV: A proposed method for extending Schottky emitter lifetime is to turn it on only duirng work hours, which may affect its stability and temperature. I wrote this script that reads the experiment's very large datafile to evaulate beam current stability and other noetworthy stats. 

FinalProj481: Final project in a Bayesian inference undergrad/grad mixed course. Annotations from the instructor are included.
